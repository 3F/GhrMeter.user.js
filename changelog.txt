[0.6] 2019.02.09

    * FIXED: Fixed the work with modern GitHub Releases ~ February 2019
    * CHANGED: Added non-mangled version https://github.com/3F/GhrMeter.user.js/releases
               Use this IF you are worried about safety -_-
               
               But anyway, the original src was compiled via Babel 7.
               Therefore, part of this code it's a generated code for compatibility 
               with target platforms: '> 0.25%, not dead'
               
               Or just compile it yourself: https://github.com/3F/GhrMeter.user.js
               
    * NOTE: Tested via Firefox 65.0 + Greasemonkey 4.7
