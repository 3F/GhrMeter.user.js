### How to use

As the most easy way, you need to have an userscript manager like Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and so on.

Then, either just click **[here](https://3F.github.io/GhrMeter.user.js/releases/latest/)** and follow the installation instructions from your userscript manager.

**Or** add this manually(again via userscript manager), **or** use any other your favorite way. It does not matter because this code will work immediately after loading into DOM.

Enjoy!
