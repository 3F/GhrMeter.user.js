### How to install

As the most easy way, you need to have an userscript manager like Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and so on. Click **[here](https://3F.github.io/GhrMeter.user.js/releases/latest/)** and follow the installation instructions from your userscript manager.

**Or** add manually as you prefer. It does not matter "how" because this code will work immediately after loading into DOM.
